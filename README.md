## Installation

After cloning the git repo run `npm install` from a terminal window.

**Note**: On unix based platforms, this will need to be run with `sudo` and on Windows, the command prompt will require administrative privileges. 

## Updating

`gulp cleanModules` will make sure that all the modules are the latest versions and ascertain that there are no unneeded modules downloaded. 

This will reduce the ammount of conflicts rising from versioning and previous experiments. 

## Running

To run the website server, execute `gulp start` from a terminal window. Then navigate to http://localhost:8080. 

## Linting

Running `gulp jshint` will lint any Javascript file under the `src` folder excluding `src/lib`.
